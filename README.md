Why did i make SkCreator?

I made SkCreator to make it for server owners who use skript and don't know how to use it to make it more simplified for them. Everything is automated via guis in-game and it adds it to the skript file in real time!

Please do note though there is no auto reload feature at the moment, so we do advise for you to reload it manually!!
